- 👋 Hi, I’m @lcmp87
- 👀 I’m interested in skate, crypto, coding and gaming
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web3 projects
- 📫 How to reach me: DM me

My work in web3 consists of developing smart contracts and backend/frontend for NFT Marketplaces, Minting sites, DeFi, Solidity Bots, Flash Loans, NTTs, Private token sales, and more. I can do front-end as much as backend or solidity. I’m currently employed at Always August, a Toronto based web developer company, as Web3 Engineer. 

I’m not your average dev, I bring more than just typing some words on solidty or typescript just to earn a living. I feel very passionate about coding and learning more about how to better myself as a developer and as a team player that can be of benefit to my co-workers and a useful and resourceful asset to my managers so we can all get a great product on market.

My stack consists of: <br>
• Solidity • Remix IDE • Smart Contract Auditing software • Linux • Git • The Graph Protocol • Chainlink Protocol • OpenZeppelin libraries • GraphQL • Typescrypt • Javascirpt • Redux • React • NextJS • Web3 • Ethers • Truffle • Hardhat • TailwindCSS • Photoshop • Premiere Pro • Firebase • Python • HTML5 • CSS • Netlify Pro • Github Pro • Excel Macros • Visual Basic • C++ • EVM OpCode • EVM Bytecode • Vyper
