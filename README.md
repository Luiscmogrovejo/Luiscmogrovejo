My work in web3 consists of developing smart contracts and backend/frontend for NFT Marketplaces, Minting sites, DeFi, Solidity Bots, Flash Loans, NTTs, Private token sales, and more. I can do front-end as much as backend or solidity. I‚Äôm currently employed at Always August, a Toronto based web developer company, as Web3 Engineer. 

I‚Äôm not your average dev, I bring more than just typing some words on solidty or typescript just to earn a living. I feel very passionate about coding and learning more about how to better myself as a developer and as a team player that can be of benefit to my co-workers and a useful and resourceful asset to my managers so we can all get a great product on market.
